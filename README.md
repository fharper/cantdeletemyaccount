# A public shaming list of websites not having a "delete my account" option

Don't you like having to send an email to customer support to have your account deleted? I don't! Most websites have a profile editing page, so adding a link or button giving the users the possibility to delete their account, hence, their data from the database or services they don't use anymore is not complicated. For lack of a better term, most of the time, I firmly believe this is a dark pattern. Why make it easier for people to delete their account? After all, we live in a world where KPI are everything...

This list should be a way for us, users, to publicly shame the websites who aren't giving that option, with the end goal of getting enough community pressure to "force" them to add this option, and make it default in every website where we need to create an account.

## Share the love
Feel free to share this list on Twitter using the hashtag [#cantdeletemyaccount](https://twitter.com/hashtag/cantdeletemyaccount). Even better if you tag the website you added to the list or the one you wanted to add if it's already on the list. We had enough. Also, if you [tag me](https://twitter.com/fharper) in your tweet, I'll be more than happy to start a discussion (see [example](https://twitter.com/BlurbBooks/status/1238650092103634945)) with the website you mentioned because in the end, the idea is to change things.

## Help with the list
Please, submit a PR (add them in alphabetical order) as you come across new websites... Maybe a website will come out of this!

It's time for them to respect our privacy, data and make it easier to delete our account!

P.S.: It's too time consuming for me to validate all submissions as I would have to create an account on each website to see if we can delete it, so if your website is listed here and shouldn't because your users have the option to delete theirs account themselves, please submit an issue or a PR and we will update the list.
